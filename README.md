# Smart Home Automation using ESP32

## Description
This project demonstrates a smart home automation system using an ESP32 microcontroller. It uses an ultrasonic sensor, LDR sensor, and rain drop sensor to monitor distance, light intensity, and weather conditions. Based on sensor readings, automation actions can be performed to improve safety and convenience in a home environment.

## Components Used
- ESP32 Development Board  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)  
- Rain Drop Sensor Module  
- Jumper Wires  
- Breadboard  
- USB Cable  

## Working Principle
The ESP32 continuously reads data from the connected sensors.  
- The ultrasonic sensor detects distance or object presence.  
- The LDR sensor measures light intensity.  
- The rain drop sensor detects rainfall.  

Based on predefined conditions in the program, the ESP32 processes these inputs and performs automation logic such as alerts or control actions.

## Features
- Multi-sensor based home automation  
- Real-time sensor monitoring  
- ESP32-based embedded system design  
- Beginner-friendly project  

## Future Improvements
- Add WiFi connectivity for remote monitoring  
- Integrate a mobile or web application  
- Control appliances using relays  
- Add more sensors like gas or temperature sensors
